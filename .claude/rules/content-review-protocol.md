# Content Review Protocol

Three-phase review for content changes to `content/_index.md`.

## Phase 1: Report

After making changes, review and report:

**For paper entries:**
- Paper title matches the linked journal/SSRN page
- Author names and order are correct
- Venue name uses the standard abbreviation (e.g., "Review of Financial Studies" not "RFS")
- Year/status is accurate (published year, "forthcoming", "R&R at X", month+year for working papers)
- All links (paper, appendix, replication code) are functional
- Abstract text is complete and properly formatted

**For teaching entries:**
- School name and date range are correct
- Course names and levels (BBA, MBA, PhD, etc.) are accurate
- Entries are in reverse chronological order

**For bio updates:**
- Title and affiliation are current
- Description is factually accurate

## Phase 2: Approve

Present the report to the user. Wait for explicit approval before committing.

Exception: Typo fixes and date corrections can be applied without a separate approval step, but must still be reported.

## Phase 3: Apply

After approval, commit the changes following the verification checklist.
